# Spacetime Calculator

## What will the application do?

This application will allow users to plot events in two-dimensional spacetime. They will be able to see how events transform between reference frames, and how concepts such as simultaneity or two events being in the same place are frame-dependent. Additionally, it will allow users to calculate how far two events are from each other in spacetime; whether they are timelike, spacelike, or null separated; and whether they appear to be simultaneous or in the same place in a given frame.

## Who will use it?

The primary audience for this application would be physics students looking to gain a deeper understanding of Lorentz transformations and special relativity. However, it may also be of interest to those with just a cursory interest in modern physics who are looking to qualitatively learn about special relativity.

## Why is this project of interest to you?

As a student pursuing a combined honours in physics and computer science, I have a deep interest in computational physics and would like to gain more experience in the field. Additionally, I believe that developing and using this application will allow me to more thoroughly understand concepts that I am learning in my courses on linear algebra and relativity and quanta.

## User Stories

* As a user, I want to be able to add an arbitrary number of events to my spacetime diagram.
* As a user, I want to be able to create an arbitrary number of reference frames moving relative to a stationary frame.
* As a user, I want to be able to determine whether two events are timelike, spacelike, or null separated.
* As a user, I want to be able to switch reference frames and see how an event's position and time change.
* As a user, I want to be able to save a world's events and reference frames to file.
* As a user, I want to be able to load a world's events and reference frames from file.
